That is why we are going to concentrate not only on the “how” but also on the “why”, so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. We’ll cover just about everything - from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Using Javascript to Build Web Applications ~.~ In this module, we are going to take all those newly learned Javascript language skills and learn how to utilize them within the context of a web page.

Learn how to diagnose and repair basic networking and security problems.,free,4.8,Approx. 7 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Networking Fundamentals ~.~ Communication is involved in almost every aspect of daily life. In today’s world, computer networking plays a vital role in communication. Talking with family and friends, paying a bill, checking out at the grocery store, keeping up on the news, and, of course, all the things that go on at work. All of these depend on some form of computer networking. Computer networking is defined as the connection of people through the use of devices and cables, and sometimes wireless signals.  This week, you will learn about the basic types and shapes of networks and how they are used. You will also learn about wired connections, wireless connections, and network devices. You will also learn about the basic instructions computers follow so they can connect us in ways we expect. You will understand how data is packaged electronically, which rules are used to send the data, how those rules are made, and how computers determine where to send those data packages. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Setting up Wired/Wireless Connections and their Use Cases ~.~ One of the key components of communicating is understanding *how* to communicate. That includes knowing what enables communication, and what blocks it. This is just as true for computer networking as it is for person-to-person interactions. If you don’t understand the ways to get data from one point to another, the data will never arrive where you want it to. ~.~ This week you will learn about the physical connectors that transmit data. And you’ll learn the basic steps for setting up small office or home office networks—both wired and wireless. You’ll also learn more about wireless network types and mobile configurations. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Storage Types and Network Sharing ~.~ As we’ve discussed, connection plays a vital role in communication. Another key component in communication is memory; information is not useful if it can’t be recalled. Network storage is where the memory is located in computer networking.  This week you will learn about different types of network storage. You’ll learn about short-term and long-term memory, and the different ways that memory can be arranged to increase capacity and efficiency. You’ll also learn about local, offsite, and cloud memory and how all these different kinds of memory enable faster and more efficient interaction between people, devices, and software. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Final Exam ~.~ ","Networking Fundamentals ,Networking Fundamentals Part II,Configuring and Troubleshooting Networks,Storage Types and Network Sharing ,Final Quiz and Assignment,Instructor,Offered by,Recommended if you're interested in Networking,More questions","IBM Skills Network TeamIBM58 Courses•840,269 learners,IBMLearn moreCloseOffered byIBMIBM is the global leader in business transformation through an open hybrid cloud platform and AI, serving clients in more than 170 countries around the world.

We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice. To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview.

The important concepts of scalar and vector fields will be introduced. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Differentiation ~.~ Scalar and vector fields can be differentiated.  We define the partial derivative and derive the method of least squares as a minimization problem.  We learn how to use the chain rule for a function of several variables, and derive the triple product rule used in chemical engineering.  We define the gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian.

Cassini's identity is the basis for a famous dissection fallacy colourfully named  the Fibonacci bamboozlement.  A dissection fallacy is an apparent paradox arising from two arrangements of different area from one set of puzzle pieces.

To construct a continued fraction is to construct a sequence of rational numbers that converges to a target irrational number.  The golden ratio is the irrational number whose continued fraction converges the slowest.  We say that the golden ratio is the irrational number that is the most difficult to approximate by a rational number, or that  the golden ratio is the most irrational of the irrational numbers.

102,Introduction to Mathematical Thinking,Math and Logic,course,Intermediate Level,Learn how to think the way mathematicians do – a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.,free,4.8,Approx. 39 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Week 1 ~.~ START with the Welcome lecture. It explains what this course is about. (It comes with a short Background Reading assignment, to read before you start the course, and a Reading Supplement on Set Theory for use later in the course, both in downloadable PDF format.) This initial orientation lecture is important, since this course is probably not like any math course you have taken before – even if in places it might look like one!  AFTER THAT, Lecture 1 prepares the groundwork for the course; then in Lecture 2 we dive into the first topic. This may all look like easy stuff, but tens of thousands of former students found they had trouble later by skipping through Week 1 too quickly! Be warned. If possible, form or join a study group and discuss everything with them. BY THE WAY, the time estimates for watching the video lectures are machine generated, based on the video length. Expect to spend a lot longer going through the lectures sufficiently well to understand the material. The time estimates for completing the weekly Problem Sets (Quiz format) are a bit more reliable, but even they are just a guideline. You may find yourself taking a lot longer. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 2 ~.~ In Week 2 we continue our discussion of formalized parts of language for use in mathematics. By now you should have familiarized yourself with the basic structure of the course: 1. Watch the first lecture and answer the in-lecture quizzes; tackle each of the problems in the associated Assignment sheet; THEN watch the tutorial video for the Assignment sheet. 2. REPEAT sequence for the second lecture. 3. THEN do the Problem Set, after which you can view the Problem Set tutorial. REMEMBER, the time estimates for watching the video lectures are machine generated, based on the video length. Expect to spend a lot longer going through the lectures sufficiently well to understand the material. The time estimates for completing the weekly Problem Sets (Quiz format) are a bit more reliable, but even they are just a guideline. You may find yourself taking a lot longer. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 3 ~.~ This week we continue our analysis of language for use in mathematics. Remember, while the parts of language we are focusing have particular importance in mathematics, our main interest is in the analytic process itself: How do we formalize concepts from everyday life? Because the topics become more challenging, starting this week we have just one basic lecture cycle (Lecture -> Assignment -> Tutorial ->  Problem Set -> Tutorial) each week. If you have not yet found one or more people to work with, please try to do so. It is so easy to misunderstand this material. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 4 ~.~ This week we complete our analysis of language, putting into place the linguistic apparatus that enabled, mathematicians in the 19th Century to develop a formal mathematical treatment of infinity, thereby finally putting Calculus onto a firm footing, three hundred years after its invention. (You do not need to know calculus for this course.) It is all about being precise and unambiguous. (But only where it counts. We are trying to extend our fruitfully-flexible human language and reasoning, not replace them with a rule-based straightjacket!) ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 5 ~.~ This week we take our first look at mathematical proofs, the bedrock of modern mathematics. ~.~ Week 6 ~.~ This week we complete our brief look at mathematical proofs ~.~ Week 7 ~.~ The topic this week is the branch of mathematics known as Number Theory. Number Theory, which goes back to the Ancient Greek mathematicians, is a hugely important subject within mathematics, having ramifications throughout mathematics, in physics, and in some of today's most important technologies. In this course, however, we consider only some very elementary parts of the subject, using them primarily to illustrate mathematical thinking. ~.~ Week 8 ~.~ In this final week of instruction, we look at the beginnings of the important subject known as Real Analysis, where we closely examine the real number system and develop a rigorous foundation for calculus. This is where we really benefit from our earlier analysis of language. University math majors generally regard Real Analysis as extremely difficult, but most of the problems they encounter in the early days stem from not having made a prior study of language use, as we have here. ~.~ Weeks 9 & 10: Test Flight ~.~ Test Flight provides an opportunity to experience an important aspect of ""being a mathematician"": evaluating real mathematical arguments produced by others. There are three stages. It is important to do them in order, and to not miss any steps. STAGE 1: You complete the Test Flight Problem Set (available as a downloadable PDF with the introductory video), entering your solutions in the Peer Evaluation module. STAGE 2: You complete three Evaluation Exercises, where you evaluate solutions to the Problem Set specially designed to highlight different kinds of errors. The format is just like the weekly Problem Sets, with machine grading. You should view the Tutorial video for each Exercise after you submit your solutions, but BEFORE you start the next Exercise. STAGE 3: You evaluate three Problem Set solutions submitted by other students. (This process is anonymous.) This final stage takes place in the Peer Evaluation module. After you are done peer reviewing, you may want to evaluate your own solution. It can be very informative to see how you rate your own attempt after looking at the work of others.","Vectors,Differentiation,Integration and Curvilinear Coordinates,Line and Surface Integrals,Fundamental Theorems,Instructor,Offered by,Recommended if you're interested in Math and Logic,More questions","Top InstructorJeffrey R.

Hypothesis-driven decisions. Specifically, you need to shift your teammates focus from their natural tendency to focus on their own output to focusing out user outcomes.

In this module, you’ll learn how to make concept testing an integral part of your product pipeline. We’ll continue to apply methods from Lean Startup, looking at how they pair with agile. We’ll look at how high-functioning teams design and run situation-appropriate experiments to test ideas, and how that works before the fact (when you’re testing an idea) and after the fact (when you’re testing the value of software you’ve released). ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ How Do We Consistently Deliver Great Usability? ~.~ The best products are tested for usability early and often, avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a ""big unveil."" In this module, you’ll learn how to diagnose, design and execute phase-appropriate user testing. The tools you’ll learn to use here (a test plan template, prototyping tool, and test session infrastructure) are accessible/teachable to anyone on your team. And that’s a very good thing -- often products are released with poor usability because there ""wasn’t enough time"" to test it. With these techniques, you’ll be able to test early and often, reinforcing your culture of experimentation. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ How Do We Invest to Move Fast? ~.~ You’ve learned how to test ideas and usability to reduce the amount of software your team needs to build and to focus its execution. Now you’re going to learn how high-functioning teams approach testing of the software itself. The practice of continuous delivery and the closely related Devops movement are changing the way we build and release software. It wasn’t that long ago where 2-3 releases a year was considered standard. Now, Amazon, for example, releases code every 11.6 seconds.

We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code. ~.~ Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration ~.~ Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.

It faces the following questions: What is science? What is scientific research? What is the relation between scientific progress and the progress of society? What is the relation between research and innovation? Why should researchers engage themselves publicly? ~.~ WEEK 2 - Research Methodology ~.~ Week 2 focuses on research methods. It discusses the interplay between invention — the creative act that identifies an interesting open problem and a possible solution — and validation — the meticulous process through which the identified solution is critically evaluated. It briefly discusses the historical evolution of the notion of a “scientific method”, through which research results are validated, mainly developed in the context of physical and natural sciences.

159,"Ethics, Technology and Engineering",Research Methods,course,Beginner Level,"There is an increasing attention to ethics in engineering practice. Engineers are supposed not only to carry out their work competently and skilfully, but also to be aware of the broader ethical and social implications of engineering and to be able to reflect on these.  According to the Engineering Criteria 2000 of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, engineers must have “an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” and should ""understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context.”",free,4.7,Approx. 19 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"The responsibility of engineers ~.~ This module discusses the responsibility of engineers. We will investigate what exactly responsibility is, distinguishing between passive responsibility for things that happened in the past and active responsibility for things not yet attained.  Furthermore, we will discuss the professional responsibility of engineers, examine the consequences for this responsibility, such as whistle-blowing and the application of the precautionary principle. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Codes of conduct ~.~ In this module, we discuss the role of codes of conduct in engineering. In particular, we focus on professional codes as they have been proposed by professional engineering societies and on corporate codes, as they have been formulated by companies. We discuss these two types of codes, their structure and their content, and a number of common objections that have been levelled against codes of conduct. This includes the problem that someone is acting according to the code, but that it may nevertheless lead to dismissal. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Normative ethics ~.~ In this module we will discuss some ethical theories that have been developed by various philosophers. Ethical theories help us to sort out our thinking and to develop a coherent and justifiable basis for dealing with moral questions. The role of ethical theories is to provide certain arguments or reasons for a moral judgment. They provide a normative framework for understanding and responding to moral problems, so improving ethical decision-making or, at least, avoiding certain shortcuts, such as neglecting certain relevant features of the problem or just stating an opinion without any justification. In this module we shall therefore introduce three of the most well-known ethical theories: consequentialism, duty ethics and virtue ethics. These theories each have their own criteria with which they determine whether an action is right or wrong. Before we go into these three theories we shall discuss what we mean by morality and ethics, and we shall look into the points of departure of ethics: values, norms, and virtues. These points of departure often recur in ethical theories. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ The ethical cycle ~.~ Engineers will encounter in their professional life some difficult moral situations. Such situations call for moral judgment, using the tools we have introduced in the preceding modules. However, moral judgment is not a straightforward or linear process in which you simply apply ethical theories to find out what to do. Instead it is a process in which the formulation of the moral problem, the formulation of possible ‘solutions’, and the ethical judging of these solutions go hand in hand. This messy character of moral problems, however, does not rule out a systematic approach. In this module we describe a systematic approach to problem solving that does justice to the complex nature of moral problems and moral judgment: the ethical cycle. Our goal is to provide a structured method of addressing moral problems which helps to guide a sound analysis of these problems. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Ethical questions in the design of technology ~.~ Disasters like the Challenger illustrates the importance of design to engineering. In this case, as in other cases, the design phase was crucial for the proper working of a technology and possible risks and other side effects. The example also shows the importance of activities that are closely related to design like testing, certification and inspection. Second, the example shows that most design involves trade-offs. In wheel design for trains, e.g., a trade-off is faced between energy (and cost) efficiency and comfort. We start with a description of what designing is and what type of ethical issues may arise in the various stages of the design process. Next, we shall take a closer look at one aspect of the design: the choice between different conceptual designs in the light of design requirements and trade-offs. ~.~ Designing morality ~.~ Technological artefacts can be politically or morally charged. This means that ethics is not just a matter of people but also of things. To better understand, the moral role of technological artefacts, we will elaborate this notion of ‘technological mediation’. After this, the implications of this mediation approach for ethics will be investigated, especially to what extent we can moralize technology. ~.~ Ethical aspects of technological risks ~.~ To a certain extent hazards are inherent to technology. In this module, we shall discuss the moral issues that are raised by the risks and hazards of technologies, and how engineers can deal with those issues. We will discuss the current methods for assessing risks, and the moral acceptability of technological risks. ~.~ Distribution of responsibility ~.~ It is often very difficult to pinpoint responsibility and blame in cases in which many people are involved in an activity and in which many causes contributed to a disaster. Dealing with the problem of many hands requires attention for the distribution of responsibility in engineering. In this module we will discuss how responsibilities are actually distributed in engineering, and how the resulting responsibility distribution can be evaluated in terms of moral fairness (are the appropriate persons held responsible?) and in terms of effectiveness (does the responsibility distribution contribute to avoiding harm and in achieving beneficial results?) ~.~ Exam ~.~ ","The necessary art of persuasion: Understanding what matters to your audience,Telling your story: Developing a dramatic narrative,Connecting with people: Developing authenticity and building rapport,Talk the talk: Creating impressions and guiding influential conversations,Painful truth: Dealing with objections and overcoming resistance,Winning over hearts and minds: How to pitch a brilliant idea,Instructors,Offered by,Recommended if you're interested in Leadership and Management,More questions","Associate Professor Lawrence AngMacquarie University5 Courses•122,249 learners,Arabella MacPhersonMacquarie University7 Courses•156,618 learners,Macquarie UniversityLearn moreCloseOffered byMacquarie UniversityMacquarie is ranked among the top one per cent of universities in the world, and with a 5-star QS rating, we are recognised for producing graduates who are among the most sought-after professionals in the world.

We learn how to use Taylor series to estimate the error of the finite-difference approximations to derivatives and how to increase the accuracy of the approximations using longer operators. We also learn how to implement numerical derivatives using Python. ~.~ Week 03 The Finite-Difference Method - 1D Wave Equation - von Neumann Analysis ~.~ We develop the finite-difference algorithm to the acoustic wave equation in 1D, discuss boundary conditions and how to initialize a simulation example. We look at solutions using the Python implementation and observe numerical artifacts. We analytically derive one of the most important results of numerical analysis – the CFL criterion which leads to a conditionally stable algorithm for explicit finite-difference schemes. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 04 The Finite-Difference Method in 2D - Numerical Anisotropy, Heterogeneous Media ~.~ We develop the solution to the 2D acoustic wave equation, compare with analytical solutions and demonstrate the phenomenon of numerical (non-physical) anisotropy. We extend the von Neumann Analysis to 2D and derive numerical anisotropy analytically. We learn how to initialize a realistic physical problem and illustrate that 2D solution are already quite powerful to understand complex wave phenomena. We introduced the 1D elastic wave equation and show the concept of staggered-grid schemes with the coupled first-order velocity-stress formulation. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Week 05 The Pseudospectral Method, Function Interpolation ~.~ We start with the problem of function interpolation leading to the concept of Fourier series. We move to the discrete Fourier series and highlight their exact interpolation properties on regular spatial grids. We introduce the derivative of functions using discrete Fourier transforms and use it to solve the 1D and 2D acoustic wave equation. The necessity to simulate waves in limited areas leads us to the definition of Chebyshev polynomials and their uses as basis functions for function interpolation. We develop the concept of differentiation matrices and discuss a solution scheme for the elastic wave equation using Chebyshev polynomials. ~.~ Week 06 The Linear Finite-Element Method - Static Elasticity ~.~ We introduce the concept of finite elements and develop the weak form of the wave equation. We discuss the Galerkin principle and derive a finite-element algorithm for the static elasticity problem based upon linear basis functions.  We also discuss how to implement boundary conditions. The finite-difference based relaxation method is derived for the same equation and the solution compared to the finite-element algorithm. ~.~ Week 07 The Linear Finite-Element Method - Dynamic Elasticity ~.~ We extend the finite-element solution to the elastic wave equation and compare the solution scheme to the finite-difference method. To allow direct comparison we formulate the finite-difference solution in matrix-vector form and demonstrate the similarity of the linear finite-element method and the finite-difference approach. We introduce the concept of h-adaptivity, the space-dependence of the element size for heterogeneous media. ~.~ Week 08 The Spectral-Element Method - Lagrange Interpolation, Numerical Integration ~.~ We introduce the fundamentals of the spectral-element method developing a solution scheme for the 1D elastic wave equation. Lagrange polynomials are discussed as the basis functions of choice. The concept of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre numerical integration is introduced and shown that it leads to a diagonal mass matrix making its inversion trivial. ~.~ Week 09 The Spectral Element Method - 1D Elastic Wave Equation, Convergence Test ~.~ We finalize the derivation of the spectral-element solution to the elastic wave equation. We show how to calculate the required derivatives of the Lagrange polynomials making use of Legendre polynomials. We show how to perform the assembly step leading to the final solution system for the elastic wave equation. We demonstrate the numerical solution for homogenous and heterogeneous media.","Learn step-by-step,Instructor,Offered by,More questions","Nariman Gamal LotfiCoursera Project Network3 Courses•4,011 learners,Coursera Project NetworkLearn moreCloseOffered byCoursera Project NetworkThe Coursera Project Network is a select group of instructors who have demonstrated expertise in specific tools or skills through their industry experience or academic backgrounds in the topics of their projects.

The different methodologies that will be presented here can be applied to very wide range of topics such as fluid motion, stellar dynamics, population evolution, ... This course does not intend to go deeply into any numerical method or process and does not provide any recipe for the resolution of a particular problem. It is rather a basic guideline towards different methodologies that can be applied to solve any kind of problem and help you pick the one best suited for you.",free,4.2,Approx. 23 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Introduction and general concepts ~.~ This module gives an overview of the course and presents the general ideas about modeling and simulation. An emphasis is given on ways to represent space and time from a conceptual point of view. An insight of modeling of complex systems is given with the simulation of the grothw and thrombosis of giant aneurysms. Finally, a first class of modeling approaches is presented: the Monte-Carlo methods. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Introduction to programming with Python 3 ~.~ This module intends to provide the most basic concepts of high performance computing used for modeling purposes. It also aims at teaching the basics of Python 3 which will be the programming language used for the quizzes in this course. ~.~ Dynamical systems and numerical integration ~.~ Dynamical systems modeling is the principal method developed to study time-space dependent problems. It aims at translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical set of equations. Once this basic step is performed the principal obstacle is the actual resolution of the obtained mathematical problem. Usually these equations do not possess an analytical solution and advanced numerical methods must be applied to solve them. In this module you will learn the basics of how to write mathematical equations representing natural phenomena and then how to numerically solve them. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Cellular Automata ~.~ This module defines the concept of cellular automata by outlining the basic building blocks of this method. Then an insight of how to apply this technique to natural phenomena is given. Finally the lattice gas automata, a subclass of models used for fluid flows, is presented. ~.~ Lattice Boltzmann modeling of fluid flow ~.~ This module provides an introduction to the lattice Boltzmann method, a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics. The lesson is practice oriented and show, step by step, how to write a program for the lattice Boltzmann method. The program is used to showcase an interesting problem in fluid dynamics, the simulation of a vortex street behind an obstacle. ~.~ Particles and point-like objects ~.~ A short review of classical mechanics, and of numerical methods used to integrate the equations of motions for many interacting particles is presented. The student will learn that the computational expense of resolving all interaction between particles poses a major obstacle to simulating such a system. Specific algorithms are presented to allow to cut down on computational expense, both for short-range and large-range forces. The module focuses in detail on the Barnes-Hut algorithm, a tree algorithm which is popular a popular approach to solve the N-Body problem. ~.~ Introduction to Discrete Events Simulation ~.~ In this module, we will see an alternative approach to model systems which display a trivial behaviour most of the time, but which may change significantly under a sequence of discrete events. Initially developed to simulate queue theory systems (such as consumer waiting queue), the Discrete Event approach has been apply to a large variety of problems, such as traffic intersection modeling or volcanic hazard predictions. ~.~ Agent based models ~.~ Agent Based Models (ABM) are used to model a complex system by decomposing it in small entities (agents) and by focusing on the relations between agents and with the environment. This approach is derived from artificial intelligence research and is currently used to model various systems such as pedestrian behaviour, social insects, biological cells, etc.","Learn step-by-step,Instructor,Offered by,More questions","Carmen RojasCoursera Project Network24 Courses•30,671 learners,Coursera Project NetworkLearn moreCloseOffered byCoursera Project NetworkThe Coursera Project Network is a select group of instructors who have demonstrated expertise in specific tools or skills through their industry experience or academic backgrounds in the topics of their projects.

Join us and learn to separate sloppy science from solid research!,free,4.7,Approx. 30 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Origins of the scientific method ~.~ Science is all about gaining knowledge, coming up with the best possible explanations of the world around us. So how do we decide which explanation is the best one? How do we make sure our explanations are accurate? ~.~ How do we determine we actually know something? In science we try to resolve these questions by using a set of principles and procedures called the scientific method. You need to know its historical and philosophical  'origin story' to really understand the scientific method and to fully appreciate how hard it is to apply the scientific method in the social and behavioral sciences! ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ The Scientific Method ~.~ In the first module we discussed how the scientific method developed, general philosophical approaches and the types of knowledge science aims to find. In this second module we'll make these abstract principles and concepts a little more concrete by discussing the empirical cycle and causality in more detail. We’ll see how, and in what order these concepts are implemented when we conduct a research study. We'll also consider the main criteria for evaluating the methodological quality of a research study: Validity and reliability. The focus will be on internal validity and how internal validity can be threatened. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Research Designs ~.~ In the previous module we discussed the empirical cycle, causality and the criteria for methodological quality, focusing on threats to internal validity. In this module we'll consider the most frequently used research designs and we'll see how they address threats to internal validity. We'll look at experimental, quasi-experimental and correlational designs, as well as some other designs you should be familiar with. To understand and appreciate these designs we will discuss some general concepts such as randomization and matching in a little more detail. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Measurement ~.~ Choosing a design is only the first step in the deduction phase (remember the empirical cycle?). The second step is deciding on specific ways to measure the variables of interest and disinterest. ~.~ This step is extremely important, because even if we are able to perform a true double-blind experiment, if our measurement and manipulation method are of poor quality, then internal validity will still be compromised! 

In this module we'll look at what measurement is exactly and what the criteria for evaluating measurement are. We will also look more in-depth at self-report measures, including survey, questionnaires and tests.

Excel with its extraordinarily broad range of features and capabilities is one of the most widely used programs for doing this. In the first course of our Excel Skills for Data Analysis and Visualization Specialization, you will learn the fundamentals of Excel for data analysis. When you have completed the course, you will be able to use a range of Excel tools and functions to clean and prepare data for analysis; automate data analysis with the help of Named Ranges and Tables; and use logical and lookup functions to transform, link and categorise data.",free,4.8,Approx. 15 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Cleaning and manipulating text ~.~ By the end of this module, you will be an expert in Excel's Text functions. This module discusses ways you can extract information and manipulate data to fulfil specific business requirements. You will develop techniques for working confidently with these Excel functions and unlock the full power of Excel by manipulating and cleaning text data. This is really important because you cannot properly analyse data if it is invalid or in an unsuitable format. You will begin with the mechanics of creating a function, specifying multiple arguments, and then you will look at how to work with text in functions. You will also learn how to use multiple functions in a single formula — a technique known as nesting. The topics you will be learning this week: Functions for Combining Text; Functions for Splitting Text; Combining Text Functions; Cleaning Data & Changing Case; and Removing and replacing unwanted characters. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Working with numbers and dates ~.~ By the end of this module, you will be an expert in Excel's Date functions. This module discusses ways that you can extract information and manipulate data to fulfil specific business requirements. You will also ~.~ be looking at functions for converting data types: such as text to numbers, dates to text, and then both numbers and text to dates. You will learn to solve the problem of data not being in the correct format, and you will learn how to perform arithmetic operations with dates like you would with numbers, as well as performing calculations with dates. You will also learn some really great functions specifically for solving day-to-day tricky date problems that are required in business such as the WORKDAY, EDATE and EOMONTH functions.

You will then learn about a great Excel functionality, Named Ranges — which is another way of referencing a cell or a range of cells by giving them a sensible name. You will see that named ranges make our formulas much easier to understand and you will also see how it makes them much easier to create — using tools such as Define Name and Create from Selection. You will also learn about Excel's Name Box and the Name Manager. You will learn some exciting Excel functions that allow you to aggregate and summarise data — such as SUMIFS and COUNTIFS, and much more.

171,Quantum Optics 1 : Single Photons,Physics and Astronomy,course,Beginner Level,"This course gives you access to basic tools and concepts to understand research articles and books on modern quantum optics. You will learn about quantization of light, formalism to describe quantum states of light without any classical analogue, and observables allowing one to demonstrate typical quantum properties of these states. These tools will be applied to the emblematic case of a one-photon wave packet, which behaves both as a particle and a wave. Wave-particle duality is a great quantum mystery in the  words of Richard Feynman. You will be able to fully appreciate real experiments demonstrating wave-particle duality for a single photon, and applications to quantum technologies based on single photon sources, which are now commercially available. The tools presented in this course will be widely used in our second quantum optics course, which will present more advanced topics such as entanglement, interaction of quantized light with matter, squeezed light, etc...",free,4.8,Approx. 33 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Quantization of light: one mode ~.~ In this first lesson, you will discover what is canonical quantization,  apply it to the quantization of a single mode of the electromagnetic field, and find that it behaves as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The notion of photon will then naturally emerge, as well as the weird but fundamental notion of vacuum fluctuations. ~.~ One photon state in a single mode: particle-like behaviour ~.~ In this lesson, you will discover how the quantum optics formalism leads to the particle-like behaviour of a one photon wave-packet. For this, you will have to learn the quantum optics expressions of the simple and joint photodetection signals. A comparison with the semi-classical expressions will illustrate the necessity of quantum optics. ~.~ One photon interference: Wave-Particle duality ~.~ In this lesson, you will address the fascinating question of a single photon interfering with itself, by calculating the interference pattern for a single photon launched into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In order to do it you will first learn how to treat a beam-splitter in quantum optics, a very important tool that you need to know. You will also learn that when you want to describe an optical instrument in quantum optics, it is very useful to master its classical optics description. This lesson is an opportunity to think about the mysterious concept of wave-particle duality, and about the power of the quantum formalism, which can deal consistently with two behaviours apparently contradictory . ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Multimode quantized radiation: quantum optics in a real lab ~.~ In the real world there is nothing like purely monochromatic radiation. A correct description of radiation necessarily involves several modes. In this lesson, you will learn how canonical quantization can be easily generalized to the case of several modes, and how  various observables or important quantities introduced in the single mode case are expressed in the multimode case. Beyond the formalism that you must learn to be able to read papers and books describing real situtations, you will encounter in this lesson some intriguing features of the quantum formalism: firstly, the unbelievably large size of the space of states, which is the reason for the unlimited potential power of quantum information; secondly, the question of infinities, a problem which was solved by the general procedure of renormalization. Note that optional readings are proposed as resources of some lectures. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ One photon sources in the real world ~.~ One photon sources are important components in quantum optics, both in research laboratories and in applied quantum technologies. The lesson of this week will present the various kinds of one-photon sources available today, from heralded one photon sources to one photon sources on demand. You will learn how  to use the multimode formalism presented in a previous lesson, to describe one-photon wave packets, in particular in the case of a spontaneously emitted photon. You will start with the presentation of a theoretical  tool much used in  quantum optics, the Heisenberg formalism. It will allow you to discover the formula expressing the probability of a double detection at two different times. You will also learn some `tricks of the trade' about Fourier transforms. ~.~ Wave-particle duality for a single photon in the real world ~.~ You are now ready to develop the description of a real experiment , which was the first one to reveal directly the dual nature -- wave and particle, of a real single photon wave-packet. You will not only be able to describe, with the formalism you have learned, both the particle-like and the wave-like behaviors, but you will also see how to take into account the  features of a real experiment, which is never perfect. Last and not least, we will have the opportunity to think about the notions of wave-particle duality and complementarity, which should be not confused, and about thethe statement of Feynman, who named wave-particle duality  “a great quantum mystery”. I will try to convince you that when one identifies a mysterious behavior, one should not complain, but rather explore the possibility that something new and interesting can emerge from that mystery. ~.~ One-photon based quantum technologies ~.~ In this lesson, you will discover two quantum technologies based on one photon sources. Quantum technologies allow one to achieve a goal in a way qualitatively different from a classical technology aiming at the same goal. For instance, quantum cryptography is immune to progress in computers power, while many classical cryptography methods can in principle be broken when we have more powerful computers. Similarly, quantum random number generators yield true random numbers, while classical random number generators only produce pseudo-random numbers, which might be guessed by somebody else than the user. This lesson is also an opportunity to learn two important concepts in quantum information: (i) qubits based on photon polarization; (ii) the celebrated no-cloning theorem, at the root of the security of quantum cryptography.","Before we get started...,Origins of the scientific method,The Scientific Method,Research Designs,Measurement,Sampling,Practice, Ethics & Integrity,Catch Up,Exam Time!,Instructor,Offered by,Recommended if you're interested in Research Methods,More questions","Annemarie Zand ScholtenUniversity of Amsterdam3 Courses•179,638 learners,University of AmsterdamLearn moreCloseOffered byUniversity of AmsterdamA modern university with a rich history, the University of Amsterdam

How are they related,free,4.8,Approx. 18 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Introduction to Black Holes ~.~ Hello and welcome to the first module of Astro 101! In this module, you will become familiar with the basic structure of a black hole, learn the terminology used to describe them, and explore the history of black hole physics. ~.~ Life and Death of a Star ~.~ Stars are the progenitors of black holes. In this module the student will learn about the lifecycle of stars, how stars produce energy, and how they radiate away energy. We will explore the death of stars, and what is produced by the death of stars, on all scales ; from the building blocks of life (carbon) to black holes. ~.~ The Structure of Spacetime ~.~ What happens if you travel close to the speed of light? What happens to the passage of time as you fall towards a black hole? This module will explore relativity. We look at the many ways black holes affect the universe around them from discussions of reference frames through to the change in the passage of time as you approach a black hole. ~.~ Sizing Up Black Holes ~.~ So far discussion has focussed on either the general case for black holes, of the stellar mass variety (endpoint of a star's life). In this module students will explore the various sizes of black holes and their measurable properties. Students will learn that there are four major types of astrophysical black holes (primordial/mini black hole’s, stellar mass, intermediate mass and supermassive black holes),  and discover current theories on their formation, and what might feed them. Students will also gain an knowledge of ‘no-hair’ theorem and gravitational lensing. We will also explore the formation of supermassive black holes, intermediate mass black holes, and mini black holes in particle accelerators. ~.~ SHOW ALL SYLLABUS ~.~ SHOW ALL ~.~ Approaching a Black Hole ~.~ What would you see as you approached a black hole, using a black hole binary as a vehicle to explore black holes? In this module students will follow material as it is transferred from a companion star to a black hole via Roche lobe overflow or wind fed accretion. They will then follow that material down through the accretion disc to explore tidal forces to learn about the ways in which black holes can rip apart surrounding material. This material will then pass through the innermost stable orbit of the disc, before falling in. Students will also get the opportunity to look at jets - the outflow of material from the innermost regions of this structure. ~.~ Module Objective: Introduce properties of black holes from the outside in, through the context of a journey into the event horizon of a black hole. What would we see as we are far away? What will we see and experience as we get closer? What is a disc? What is a jet? ~.~ Crossing the Event Horizon ~.~ Module Description: What would happen if you fell into a black hole? In this module students continue on their journey through a black hole binary system, from the innermost stable orbit of the accretion disc to the singularity itself. Students will learn about the structure of a basic black hole, as well as rotating black holes. Students will explore the concept of wormholes and singularities.                          Module Objectives: Students will learn about the innermost region around a black hole, about its lack of surface and about the presence and definition of an event horizon. Students will also explore the impact that spin can have on this region, and how it is measured. Finally they will look inside the event horizon to discover the basic concepts of singularities and wormholes. ~.~ Inside a Black Hole ~.~ What is in a black hole? This module will start to explore the theoretical side of black hole physics.  You will receive a basic introduction to relevant topics of Quantum Mechanics and thermodynamics with the aim of understanding current black hole debates among the giants of the field. ~.~ Hunting for Black Holes ~.~ If black holes absorb all light, how do we see them? In this module, you will explore how astronomers observe real black holes, from studies of accretion discs and jets to the study of material orbiting a black hole. ~.~ Our Eyes in the Skies ~.~ Black holes change over time.

We then introduce the basic building blocks of biochemistry. One potential way of detecting life is through its byproducts like Methane. We discuss efforts to discuss life on Mars. ~.~ Planetary Atmospheres ~.~ This lecture begins by introducing the basic physics of gases, liquid and solids. The lecture then describes how the balance between gas pressure and gravity shapes the structure of planetary atmospheres. ~.~ The Moon ~.~ By studying the properties of the Moon, we learn not only about its history but about the formation history of the Earth. This lecture discusses the physics of craters and the tidal interactions between the Earth and the Moon. We then apply the physics of tides to see how it shapes the properties of planets around M stars. ~.~ Kepler and Transits ~.~ Transits have been an important event for astronomy for over 400 years. This lecture describes the transit of Venus and how it was used to measure the size of our Solar System. This lecture then discusses how NASA’s Kepler mission observes planetary transits and how its observations have shaped our understanding of the properties of extrasolar planetary systems. ~.~ Stellar Evolution ~.~ Like planets, the structure of stars are shaped by the balance between gravity and pressure. Nuclear fusion, the energy source at the star’s interior, converts Hydrogen to heavier elements. This lecture introduces these concepts and shows how nuclear burning drives the evolution of stars. ~.~ Formation of the Earth and the Origin of Water ~.~ This lecture discusses the physics of star and planet formation. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, collapsing gas clouds form disks that then fragment to eventually form planets. We observe a tremendous diversity of planetary systems which implies that planets, unlike Stars, have a much wider range of properties. ~.~ Extremophiles ~.~ Extremophiles are life forms that flourish in extreme environments—regions of very high (or low) temperatures, acidities, and even intense radioactivity. The lecture describes some of these fascinating life forms including the bacterial mats of Yellowstone and Deinococcus Radiodurans, the toughest creature on Earth. These extremophiles inform our understanding of astrobiology. ~.~ Habitable Zone, Fermi Paradox & SETI ~.~ The final lecture discusses the search for technologically advanced life in the Galaxy. We describe the “Fermi Paradox”: if technologically advanced life is common, then it would have long ago spread through the Galaxy. Thus, we might have expected to have already encountered life.

The focus is on practical skills - all the activities will be done in Python 3, a modern programming language used throughout astronomy.",free,4.8,Approx. 24 hours to complete,English,no prerequisites needed,"Thinking about data ~.~ This module introduces the idea of computational thinking, and how big data can make simple problems quite challenging to solve. We use the example of calculating the median and mean stack of a set of radio astronomy images to illustrate some of the issues you encounter when working with large datasets. ~.~ Big data makes things slow ~.~ In this module we explore the idea of scaling your code. Some algorithms scale well as your dataset increases, but others become impossibly slow. We look at some of the reason for this, and use the example of cross-matching astronomical catalogues to demonstrate what kind of improvements you can make. ~.~ Querying your data ~.~ Most large astronomy projects use databases to manage their data. In this module we introduce SQL - the language most commonly used to query databases. We use SQL to query the NASA Exoplanet database and investigate the habitability of planets in other solar systems. ~.~ Managing your data ~.~ This module introduces the basic principles of setting up databases. We look at how to set up new tables, and then how to combine Python and SQL to get the best out of both approaches. We use these tools to explore the life of stars in a stellar cluster. ~.~ Learning from data: regression ~.~ This module introduces the idea of machine learning. We look at standard methodology for running machine learning experiments, and then apply this to calculating redshifts of distant galaxies using decision trees for regression. ~.~ Learning from data: classification ~.~ In this final module we explore the limitations of decision tree classifiers. We then look at ensemble classifiers, using the random forest algorithm to classify images of galaxies into different types.","Quantization of light: one mode  ,One photon state in a single mode: particle-like behaviour,One photon interference: Wave-Particle duality,Multimode quantized radiation: quantum optics in a real lab,One photon sources in the real world,Wave-particle duality for a single photon in the real world,One-photon based quantum technologies ,Instructors,Offered by,Recommended if you're interested in Physics and Astronomy,More questions","Alain AspectÉcole Polytechnique2 Courses•28,855 learners,Michel BruneÉcole Polytechnique2 Courses•28,855 learners,École PolytechniqueLearn moreCloseOffered byÉcole PolytechniqueÉcole polytechnique combines research, teaching and innovation at the highest scientific and technological level worldwide to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
